Stochastic_Processes Class
--------------------------

The `Stochastic_Processes` class is a base class that provides methods for simulating 1D Brownian motion and plotting the displacement over time.

GBMSimulator Class
------------------

The `GBMSimulator` class inherits from `Stochastic_Processes` and simulates 1D geometric Brownian motion (GBM).
